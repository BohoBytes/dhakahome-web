            Our journey began from a one bedroom apartment based in Las Vegas, USA in 2003, where we started to sell plots and flats for Bashundhara Housing to Non Residential Bangladeshis.
            <br /><br />
            We represented Bashundhara Housing and took their products to every corner of the USA and Canada, to thousands of Non Residential Bangladeshis living abroad. We professionally and legally served many of their existing and potential clients, managed and maintained every transaction of Bashudhara Housing took place in North America. Our honesty, integrity and customer service rewarded us with more than three thousand sales in just three years. Soon, many other renowned Real Estate companies of Bangladesh appointed us as their exclusive sales agent. We represented some of the renowned companies named: Swadesh Properties Ltd., Biswas Builders Ltd., AG Properties Ltd., SAKPDL Properties Ltd. We proudly sold some apartment products of Shanta Properties and Building Technologies and Ideas Ltd (BTI).
            <br /><br />
